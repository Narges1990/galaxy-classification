# Galaxy Classification with CNN and Explainable AI

This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify galaxies as elliptical or non-elliptical. The model was trained on the GAMA DR3 dataset and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and misclassification analysis.

## Key Features
- Custom CNN with data augmentation
- Achieved ~98% training accuracy and ~89% validation accuracy
- Explainability using Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, and LIME
- Includes error analysis and misclassified sample visualization

## Files
- `.ipynb`: Full project notebook
- `.h5`: Trained model file
- `.png`: Output heatmaps and result plots

Prepared by Narges Davoudi for the Astroinformatics final project.
